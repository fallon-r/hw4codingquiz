# hw4codingquiz

I wanted to make this homework assignment more fun than the previous one. My initial thought process was to make the initial skeleton of the HTML by creating the cards and navbar with tall the relevant info. From there, I wanted to dynamically add the questions and scores. 

In an effort to be a smartypants, i used bootstrap, so that most stylistic changes can happen via an addclass function rather than raw coding.
